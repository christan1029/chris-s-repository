The center for Engineering Innovation & Design is a unique interdisciplinary venue where ideas can be taken past the conceptual phase and turned into something real. The dedicated 8,700 square foot facility houses an inventory of state-of-the art machine tools, instruments, and equiipment to support biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, comouter science, electrical engineering, environmental engineering, and mechanical engineering projects, including design, modeling, manufacturing and testing activities. Innovative in form and funcvtion, the Center is an open and accessible space in a high-profile location featuring areas for instruction, team meetings, computer-aided design, fabrication, and assembly. An attached cafe provides a casual meeting place for students and faculty, attracting members of the Yale community from across campus.

Spanning graduate and undergraduate education, the Center's offerings include introductory design courses open to all Yale students and multidisciplinary capstone design courses for engineering majors. Design projects are carried out through collaborations between students of multiple majors, with mentorship provided by the Center's staff and experts. Conceived to infuse engineering curricular and extracurricular activities with a continuum of cutting-edge design experiences, the Center exposes Yale students in all majors to principles of innovation and the practice of interdisciplinary collaboration.

"The center plays an essential role in promoting a culture of engineering on the Yale campus that will attract and retain top engineering students," says Dean Vanderlick. "And by enabling engineering faculty to bring hands-on design experiences into the classroom, the Center contributes to our ability to produce a uniquely Yale brand of 'Y-shaped' engineers who apply intellectual depth and breadth to innovate engineered solutions with purpoise."
